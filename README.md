# Transit Me

Uses Bart API to get the next trip between two points. Meant for me, intentionally limited in functionality!

## Usage

Run the command to get the next trip with `pnpm go` after `pnpm install`. You'll be able to enter when & to where you're going to see when you have to leave and how long it takes at each step.

## Next steps
1. Make into a webpage I can install as a widget
2. Add Strava API usage to figure out how fast I'll be at biking instead of relying on baked estimates
3. Make less generic than static options, like figuring out the closest station to a point?
